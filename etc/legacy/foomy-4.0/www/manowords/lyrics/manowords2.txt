Fight Until We Die

When they come I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align

Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand

Raise your hands
Swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight unttil we win
or we'll fight until we die

Gods of Thunder, Fire and Rain
Cut into the earth till' none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride up from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die


House Of Death

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash, my body in flames
All shall knee at the sound of my name

My path is set, I live with no regret
I am sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn and die
Die! Die! Die!
Into the house of death
Die! Die!
Into the fire of hell

Army of the heavens
My army waits in hell
To battle on the earth
For all the souls who fell

I will not go unto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death
Beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness
Into the black of night
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn and die
Die! Die! Die!
Into the house of death
Die! Die!
Into the fire of hell

Unto the darkness
I command my soul
Never shall I repent
Never shall I be saved

I'll go into the house of death
Before my last breath
My enemies all shall die

Die! Die! Die!
Into the house of death
Die! Die!
Into the fire of hell



Hand Of Doom

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, but no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind

Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die

Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
We'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand

We are high atop a mountain with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike
Now the house of death invites you, body and soul to come within

I see the fear you have inside you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived

Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
We'll always remember that we made a stand
Many will die by my hand
They will die...
High atop a mountain with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike
Now the house of death invites you, body and soul to come within

I see the fear you have inside you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived

Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But we'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
They will die, by my hand.....they will die...

An American Trilogy

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland

Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixieland I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie

In Dixieland where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morn
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on

So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials Lord will soon be over

Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on!
His truth is marching on!



Swords In The Wind

I surrender my soul Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne in Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me I'll die with honor and pride
The right of a warrior forever to fight by your side

Send a sign raise the sail wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling immortality be mine

Call the witch to cast the runes, weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born not for heaven not for hell

We are Sons of Odin the fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings who reign above in the sky

I will lead the charge my sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea, in cold wind, and rain
Sail into the black of night magic stars our guiding light

Today the blood of battle upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground laughing as they die

We are Sons of Odin the fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings who reign above in the sky

I will lead the charge my sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea, in cold wind, and rain
Sail into the black of night magic stars our guiding light

Place my body on a ship and burn it in the sea
Let my spirit rise Valkries carry me
Take me to Valhalla where my brothers wait for me
Fires burning to the sky my spirit will never die

I will lead the charge my sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea, in cold wind, and rain
Sail into the black of night magic stars our guiding light



Nessun Dorma

Nessun dorma! Nessun dorma!
Tu pure, o Principessa,
nella tua fredda stanza
guardi le stelle
che tremano d'amore
e di speranza!
Ma il mio mistero è chiuso in me,
il nome mio nessun saprà!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò,
quando la luce splenderà!
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà
il silenzio che ti fa mia!

Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincerò!
Vincerò! Vincerò



Fight For Freedom

There's a sound it´s heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your heart
And one day hope to be free

To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
Now it's our time to be free

Where the eagles fly I will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again

So ring out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years

Where the eagles fly I will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again

Now´s the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song

Where the eagles fly I will soon be there
If you want to come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again



Call To Arms

When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait now we are home

Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gathered together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait, now we are home

Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win

Armed with a heart of steel

To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel

Fight for the kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again

From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear

Till the keys of the kingdom are mine

All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight say I believe

Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdom are mine
Lets all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever your strength will never leave

The Dawn Of Battle

Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory

I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle

I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves

I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage

By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land

I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle

I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again

I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves

I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle
