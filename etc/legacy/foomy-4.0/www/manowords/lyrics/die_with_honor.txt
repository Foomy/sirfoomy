Die With Honor

If I should return
With my body on my shield
Tell my son I chose to die
Than yield

Though my life may soon be gone
I hope you'll carry on
Remember me
As one who would not kneel

Fight with blood
Fight with steel
Die with honor
Never yield
Fearless hearts
Filled with pride
Into glory we shall ride
Into glory we shall ride

I am driven on
In the face of all despair
Trust in steel
You will find me there

A sinner's fate awaits me
But my vision guides me on
I will not stray
From the path I'm set upon

I'll Fight with blood
Fight with steel
Die with honor
Never yield
Fearless hearts
Filled with pride
Into glory we shall ride
Into glory we shall ride

If I do not return
Bring my body on my shield
Tell my son I chose to die
I chose to die than yield

Fight with blood
Fight with steel
Die with honor
Never yield
Fearless hearts
Filled with pride
Into glory we shall ride
Into glory we shall ride

I'll die fighting with my brothers by my side
