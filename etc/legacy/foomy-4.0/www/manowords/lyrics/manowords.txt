Hymn Of The Immortal Warriors

A hero was he
Touching all our lives
as if he lived and died
in a single moment

Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
a man of honor

He paid with his life
for his life was the price
to pass the gates immortal

Thy journey begins
with sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die!

Long shall we remember
he who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
death's no stranger

Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell

Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise

For none but the brave
shall rise up from the grave
to see the valkyries fly

And so it was by the hand of odin
did the immortal warrior pass through
the gates of valhalla and into legend.

Rise brother rise pass valhalla�s gates
Here great warriors await

Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed

From the earth to the sky
Now the son of odin rise!

Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die!


Odin

In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me

I paid an eye for a drink of mead
and was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
of magic, of life and death

Aaah.. speared hung upside down
nine days and nights no food nor mead
the will to be a sacrifice
of myself unto myself

Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
of life and death I am king
For both do i bring by sword and spear and ring

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let valkyries fly
for they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with hero's
brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
for all of us must die!



Army Of The Dead, Part II

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die, let valkyries fly
for they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard�s halls await with heroes
brothers that have died

For thee we wait at asgard's gates
come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
for all of us must die!

Glory Majesty Unity

Deep into the heart of the battle they fought. Covered on
all sides as all converged on them, until the four could
no longer be seen. as time passed i feared them lost, then
slowly the armies separated, many were dead. I saw the four
each down on one knee, all stopped to watch and gaze
upon them with a smile of victory before sending them into
the ground.

Then they rose together to make a final stand. With their
last bit of strength they raised their arms into the air pointing
blood stained weapons to the sky. They called upon the god
of war and made ready to die. But Odin would not call
them this day to Valhalla, instead he sent thunder and
lightning to strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
one gift every warrior lives in hope of - the berserker rage!

Now filled with that strength, the power of a thousand
men was given them. No longer mortal they were touched
by the gods. This time when they took up the attack, men fell
not by tens, but by hundreds, by thousands. And when the
smoke did clear, the four spoke the words and the masses
answered the response of the warrior's prayer.

Gods of war, I call you
my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor
free from all false pride
I will crack the whip
with a bold mighty hail
cover me with death
if I should ever fail

Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail! Hail! Hail!


The Sons Of Odin

Near To The Blaze I Wander
Through This Black Night I Ponder
The Edge Of Our Mighty Swords Did Clash
Fallen By Our Axes Helmets Smashed

Glory And Fame Blood Is Our Name

Killers Of Men A Warrior�s Friend

My Name And My Deeds Will Scorch The Land

Glory And Fame Blood Is Our Name
Souls Full Of Thunder Hearts Of Steel
Killers Of Men A Warrior's Friend
Sworn To Avenge Our Fallen Brothers

Onward Into The Heart Of The Battle
Fought The Sons Of Odin
Outnumbered Many Times
Still They Fought On
Blood Poured Forth From Their Wounds
Deep Into The Earth
Vultures Waited For The Broken Shells
That Once Were Bodies
But Odin Alone Would Choose The Day
They Would Enter Valhalla
And In Their Hour Of Need
He Sent Forth Unto Them
The Berserker Rage
Now Gods And Men
They Rose Up From The Ground
Screaming Like Wild Animals
Such Is The Gift Of Absolute Power
No Blade Or Weapon Could Harm Them
They Killed Men And Horses Alike
And All Who Stood Before Them Died That Day
Hail Gods Of War



The Blood Of Odin

Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Huginn and Muninn. They circle the earth by
day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings. He wears a golden
helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves. His weapons a magic sword
and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes. His eight legged horse Sleipnir
carries him over land sea and air, the bringer of the valiant dead, the Einherjar, from
the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.

For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted
supreme wisdom. He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death. Wounded, pierced by
a spear he hung upside down for nine days. Fasting and agony he made of himself
a sacrifice to himself. Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud
cry fell screaming from the world tree. In a flash of insight the secret magic of the
runes was revealed to him. He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful
charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring
back the dead.

His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree
deep into the earth. He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the
strongest of the strong!

On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!



Blood Brothers

When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show

And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do
I am here for you

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you�re reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There�s one who shares your pain

A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla!

Into the hall of heroes shall be led
